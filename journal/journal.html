		<p>Documenting my Trip Around the US on a Segway!</p>

		<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

		<img src="images/segway2.jpg">

		<p>Well made 1200 miles alredy, and I passed
		   through some interesting places on the way :
		   Walla Walla, WA, Magie City, ID, Bountiful,
		   UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ, and Truth or
		   Consequences, NM.</p>

	        <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>

		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side
		   of the road totay:
		</p>
		 <blockquote>
			Passing cars,<br>
			When you can't see,<br>
 		        May get you,<br>
		        A glimpse,<br>
			of eternity.<br>
		</blockquote>
		 <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

		<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

		<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe finally got
	 	   everything packed and redy to go Because I'an on a segway,
		   I wasn't able to bring a hole lot with me: cell Phone, 
		   iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar.Just the essentials.
		   As Lao Tzu would have said, <q> A journey of a thousand miles
		   begins with one Segway</q>.</p>
